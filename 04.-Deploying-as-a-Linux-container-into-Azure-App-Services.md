# Deploying as a Linux container into Azure App Services

To deploy the eShopOnWeb sample to Linux Docker container on Azure App Services, from Visual Studio 2017, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Clone or download the eShopOnWeb sample to a folder on your local machine.

2. Ensure that you have installed a recent version of [Docker for Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows). You do not need to run Docker containers locally but you will need Docker command line tools to build the image.

3. Right click on the `Web` project in Visual Studio and select the `Add` menu then `Docker Support`

4. Select `Linux` and click on `OK`.  This will create a new project in your solution called `docker-compose`. This project contains the settings for deploying to Docker.

ports:
      - "80"
```

to

```
ports:
      - "80:5106"
```

6. Right click on the `Web` project and select publish

- `Container Registry` - The instance of Azure Container Registry to use to hold the images to deploy. This can be an existing registry or a new one. 

9. Click `Create` to provision the resources on Azure.
