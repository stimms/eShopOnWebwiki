# Running Locally on a Linux Container from VS2017

To deploy the eShopOnWeb sample to a local Linux Docker container, from Visual Studio 2017, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Clone or download the eShopOnWeb sample to a folder on your local machine.

2. Ensure that you have installed a recent version of [Docker for Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows)

3. Right click on the `Web` project in Visual Studio and select the `Add` menu then `Docker Support`

4. Select `Linux` and click on `OK`.  This will create a new project in your solution called `docker-compose`. This project contains the settings for deploying to Docker.

5. Open the `docker-compose.override.yml` from the `docker-compose` project and change the line that reads `80` to read `5106`. This is the port eShopOnWeb is configured to run on. (See the `Program.cs` file for details)
