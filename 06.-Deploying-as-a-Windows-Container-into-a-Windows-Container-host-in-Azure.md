To deploy the eShopOnWeb sample to a Windows 2016 virtual machine running Docker on Azure, from Visual Studio 2017, follow these step-by-step instructions:

## Provision a Virtual Machine to Host Docker

1. Log into Azure and click on the plus symbol(`+`) to create a new resource. Then select `compute` and `see all`

![Add `+` then compute and see all.](6-1.png)

2. In the search box enter `containers` and then select `Windows Server 2016 Datacenter - with Containers`

![Search for containers.](6-2.png)

3. Click create

![Click create.](6-3.png)

4. Enter a name for the virtual machine. Also provide a user name and a password to log into the virtual machine. Be sure to record the password as it will be needed in subsequent steps. Choose either an existing resource group or create a new one. Finally, click `select`

![Enter name, login credentials and resource group.](6-4.png)

5. Select a size for the virtual machine. DS1_V2 is sufficient for our needs. Click `select`

6. In the settings click on `Network security group` then click `Add inbound rule`

![Add a new security group rule](6-6.png)

7. Create a rule to expose the Docker agent port, 2375, by entering a name for the rule, a priority and the port. Click `Ok`

![Add a rule for the Docker agent](6-7.png)


8. Create a rule to expose the Web Server which will be running on the Docker agent. Entering a name for the rule, a priority and select `HTTP` from the `Service` drop down. Click `Ok`

![Add a rule for the web server](6-8.png)

9. Click `Ok` on the settings blade
10. On the purchase blade click `Purchase`

![Click on purchase](6-9.png)

11. The virtual machine will now be provisioned. Click on `Virtual Machiens` and then select your new virtual machine. 

![Click on virtual machines and then your newly provisioned machine](6-10.png)

12. Click on `Connect` to download the remote connection file for the virtual machine. You may also wish to record the IP address of your machine at this time - it will be needed later.

![Download the connection file](6-11.png)

## Configuring Docker on the Virtual Machine

1. Launch the connection by clicking on the downloaded connection file

![Launching the connection](6-12.png)

2. Agree to connect 

![Connection](6-13.png)

3. Enter the password and user name recorded earlier. You may need to click on `More Choices` to access the user name and password boxes. Click on `OK`

![Enter the user name and password](6-14.png)

4. The firewall on the server must now have ports opened to allow access to the Docker daemon and container. Click on the start menu and enter `firewall` then click on the `Windows Firewall with Advanced Security`

![Search for firewall and click on the Windows Firewall](6-15.png)

5. In the firewall settings click on `Inbound Rules` then `New Rule...`

![Click Inbound Rule and then New Rule](6-16.png)

6. Select `Port` as the rule type and click `Next`

![Set port as the type of firewall](6-17.png)

7. Select `Specific local ports` and enter `2375`. Click `Next`

![Enter port 2375](6-18.png) 

8. Select `Allow the connection` and click `Next`

![Allow the connection](6-19.png) 

9. Leave the settings on the Profile page unchanged and click `Next`

![Leave settings unchanged](6-20.png) 

10. Enter a name such as `Docker` for the firewall rule and click `Finish`

![Enter name for the rule and click next](6-21.png) 

11. In the firewall settings click on `Inbound Rules` then `New Rule...`

![Click Inbound Rule and then New Rule](6-16.png)

12. Select `Port` as the rule type and click `Next`

![Set port as the type of firewall](6-17.png)

13. Select `Specific local ports` and enter `80`. Click `Next`

![Enter port 80](6-22.png) 

14. Select `Allow the connection` and click `Next`

![Allow the connection](6-19.png) 

15. Leave the settings on the Profile page unchanged and click `Next`

![Leave settings unchanged](6-20.png) 

16. Enter a name such as `Web` for the firewall rule and click `Finish`

![Enter name for the rule and click next](6-23.png) 

17. By default the Docker daemon doesn't listen on external ports so we need to enable that. Open an administrative powershell window and enter 

    ```
    stop-service docker
    &"C:\Program Files\Docker\dockerd.exe" -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375
    ```

    ![Docker daemon running on Windows Server 2016](6-24.png) 

    The server should now be set up to allow remote Docker connections. **Note**: It is not secure to run the Docker daemon exposed to the Internet and without any authentication. For the purposes of this tutorial we'll allow it but in real world applications [other approaches are recommended](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/https/).  

## Configure Your Computer to Talk to Docker on the Virtual Machine

Your computer needs to be configured to talk to the Docker daemon on the virtual machine that was just set up. To do this we'll need to set an environment variable pointing Docker to the remote daemon. 

1. Click on the `start` button and search for `computer`. Right click on `This PC` and select `properties`

![Open This PC properties](6-25.png)

2. Select `Advanced system settings`

![Advanced system settings](6-26.png)

3. Click `Environment Variables`

![Environment Variables](6-27.png)

4. Add a new system variable called `DOCKER_HOST` set it to be `tcp://<ip address of your virtual machine>:2375`

![Advanced system settings](6-28.png)

## Build and Run the Container 

1. Clone or download the eShopOnWeb sample to a folder on your local machine.

2. Ensure the computer on which you're running has Windows containers enabled. You can read how perform the one-time setup on the [Docker Blog](https://blog.docker.com/2016/09/build-your-first-docker-windows-server-container/)

3. Right click on the `Web` project in Visual Studio and select the `Add` menu then `Docker Support`  

![Add docker support by clicking Add > RuDocker Support.](5-1.png)

4. Select `Windows` and click on `OK`.  This will create a new project in your solution called `docker-compose`. This project contains the settings for deploying to Docker. 

![Select Windows in the Docker Support Options dialog](5-2.png)


5. Update the `docker-compose.yml` to listen to forward port 80 to port 5106. Change the line 

```
ports:
      - "80"
```

to

```
ports:
      - "80:5106"
```

6. Build the project under `Release` configuration. This will deploy the image to the remote Docker daemon

7. Open an instance of powershell and run 

```
  docker run -p <ip address of your virtual machine>:80:80 web -t
```

8. Direct your web browser to http://<ip address of your virtual machine>. You should see an instance of the eShopOnline site running
